<!--Whitelists are checked first, before blacklists and before automated logic is applied.

	Whitelisted races are included in the category specified by the DefListDef even if 
		they would not be accepted by the automated logic.
	
	e.g. Moonjelly would fail the humanlike gait tests because they have tentacles
		instead of legs, but are instead allowed to learn to walk via crawling
		(because I can imagine a vaguely humanoid jellyfish crawling before it "walks" upright)
		
	If a race fails processing because of actual code errors it may still end up
		not processed even if whitelisted.

<!--Blacklists are checked after whitelists, but before automated logic.

	Blacklisted races are excluded from the cateogry specified by the DefListDef even if
		they would pass the automated checks.

<!--Whitelisted races are forced to use the crawling-to-walking pathway.
